# FeelTask

This is the FeelTask by team 5. Feeltask is the ultimate task management tool for mobile devices. It includes unique backend that can combines todos and other information from different sources. At this time it gives REST API for todos from Tracks-application.

## Structure

* Backend-implementation is in feeltask-backend -directory. It is Rails 3.2.2 application. Read more about in README in that directory. CORS support working also.
